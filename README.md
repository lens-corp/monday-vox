### A voice assistant for making changes in any board on Monday.com.

We have developed an AI voice assistant, that can be used seamlessly with Monday.com. \
Modern speech recognition technology is used by MondayVox to flawlessly and accurately comprehend your orders. Our voice assistant enables you to easily make real-time edits to your Monday.com boards while you're on the go, in a meeting, or just prefer a hands-free experience.\
It uses LLM to intelligently query the given prompt.\
MondayVox streamlines your workflow and improves cooperation by enabling you to create new items, assign them to team members, update their statuses, and delete completed tasks. Voice feedbacks are integrated to make it interactive.
